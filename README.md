Repository for Bottles components

## Why a centralized repository?
With a centralized repository we can provide some data such as the checksum, which is useful for validate downloads.

## How to contribute
There is currently no way to contribute, even by providing a Pull request. In the future this repository can be used to provide third party runners and our builds. At the moment it is for internal use only.
