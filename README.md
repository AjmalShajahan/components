# Components
Repository for Bottles components

## Why a centralized repository?
With a centralized repository we can provide some data such as the checksum, which is useful for validate downloads.

## How to contribute
There is currently no way to contribute, even by providing a Pull request. In the future this repository can be used to provide third party runners. At the moment it is for internal use only.

## Currently offered runners
We offer several runners in Bottles:
- `chardonnay` (our runner, available by default in Bottles v3)
- `lutris`
- `proton-ge`
